# SVG-Triangle-Design-1
A small SVG Project of a polygon html element that uses the points attr. to obtain x,y coordinates in a non-cartesian x,y way to create shapes. In my case i decided to make a small triangle as im getting more involved into creating games using html,css,and javascript and want to be a bit more creative by designing my own shapes.. I decided on my coordinates based on the fact, that i am seeking in designing a smaller triangle that could be used in a project game im building.
